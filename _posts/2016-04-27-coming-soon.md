description: 'I miss my dog. More than I thought I would but not to any detriment, I just remember holding Winston in my hand with room to spare 2 years ago this week. I miss standing in the open door of a Pac 750XL, 15,000ft up on a beautiful Nagambie day and the friends I made on columns of air as I embraced gravity and its reliable reaction to my letting go of the plane. I miss my Yamaha R1 and the track days and winding country roads that facilitated my escape and evasion of the myriad of problems I’d played at the minimum, a lead role in creating. I miss my V8 ute and the downhill mountain bikes, trail bikes and road bikes that had at one time been in the back while I made my way out to beautiful parts of Australia with a best mate, to put the pedals underfoot and just talk while we covered thousands of kilometres together. I miss running the trails of surrounding Melbourne, the conversations that I could sustain early on with a man I’m lucky to call a friend and listening to his observations when I was struggling to breathe – the best part being at the end when I saw how happy he was for having been out there.'

I miss my dog. More than I thought I would but not to any detriment, I just remember holding Winston in my hand with room to spare 2 years ago this week. I miss standing in the open door of a Pac 750XL, 15,000ft up on a beautiful Nagambie day and the friends I made on columns of air as I embraced gravity and its reliable reaction to my letting go of the plane. I miss my Yamaha R1 and the track days and winding country roads that facilitated my escape and evasion of the myriad of problems I'd played at the minimum, a lead role in creating. I miss my V8 ute and the downhill mountain bikes, trail bikes and road bikes that had at one time been in the back while I made my way out to beautiful parts of Australia with a best mate, to put the pedals underfoot and just talk while we covered thousands of kilometres together. I miss running the trails of surrounding Melbourne, the conversations that I could sustain early on with a man I'm lucky to call a friend and listening to his observations when I was struggling to breathe -- the best part being at the end when I saw how happy he was for having been out there.

Of course I miss these things when fondly remembered, exclusive of their cost and the extent to which they magnified me and encouraged my selfishness to increase.

Here in Thailand, 2 months into my volunteer position with Destiny Rescue those things are not as distant as they are irrelevant. I've woken up to the realities of the world we live in and the challenges facing those trying to bring our greatest shames as humans to an end.

This blog will be about living life in Asia, working in an international NGO, volunteering generally, anti-human trafficking and working against the sexual exploitation of children. It'll be sprinkled with Thai culture, the mysteries of the Thai language and the killer local cuisine as well as the occasional request for you to engage beyond reading.

Engage your minds, your friends, your workmates, your family and be prepared to feel a range of emotions and face realities that many of us would simply prefer not to face.

In all this you'll see Jesus playing a huge role. If you aren't into religion, that's great neither am I.
